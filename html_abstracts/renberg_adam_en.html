    <h1>Test-inspired runtime verification</h1>
    <h2>Using a unit test-like specification syntax for runtime
      verification</h2>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Computer software is growing ever more complex, and more sophisticated tools
are required to make sure the software operates in a correct way &mdash; i.e.
according to its specification. Traditional approaches to program verification
have much to give, but they also have their disadvantages. While formal methods
can give useful mathematical proofs about the correctness of programs, they
suffer from complexity and are difficult to use. Often they work only on a
constructed system model, not the actual program. Testing, on the other hand,
has a simple syntax and great tool support, and it is in widespread use. But it
is informal and incomplete, only testing the specific test cases that the
test-writers can come up with.
</p>
<p>
A relatively new approach called <em>runtime verification</em> is an attempt
for a lightweight alternative. It verifies a program's actual
<em>execution</em> against its specification, possibly while the program is
running.
</p>
<p>
This work investigates how testing, and specifically unit testing, can be
combined with runtime verification. It shows how the syntax of unit tests,
written in the target program's programming language, can be used to inspire
the syntax for specifications for runtime verification. Both informal and
formal specifications are described and supported.
</p>
<p>
A proof-of-concept framework for Python called <em>pythonrv</em> is implemented
and described, and it is tested on a real-life application. A formal foundation
is constructed for specifications written in a subset of Python, enabling
formal verification. Informal specifications are also supported, with the full
power of Python as specification language.
</p>
<p>
The result shows that the proof-of-concept framework allow for effective use of
runtime verification. It is easy to integrate into existing programs, and the
informal specification syntax is relatively simple. It also shows that formal
specifications can be written in Python, but in a more unwieldy syntax and
structure than the informal one. Many interesting properties can be verified
using it that ordinary tests would have trouble with.
</p>
<p>
The recommendation for future work lies in improving the specification syntax,
using unit testing concepts such as expectations, and on working to make the
formal specification syntax more like that of its informal sibling.
