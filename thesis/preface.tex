\chapter*{Preface}

This is a degree project in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH), Stockholm. The work was done at Valtech Sweden, an IT
consultancy.

I have been fortunate to have had two great supervisors: Erland Ranvinge at
Valtech and Dr.\ Narges Khakpour at the School of Computer Science and
Communication, KTH\@. They have been of great help, both in the conception of
the initial idea, and during the project, discussing problems and giving
feedback on the work and this report. Thank you!

I would also like to thank Valtech for the opportunity to do this degree
project as part of a trainee program, and for all the great colleagues there
giving their feedback and support, especially on the development of the
internal web application described in Chapter~\ref{chapter-evaluation}.

And last, I would like to thank the many proofreaders. Without them, this
report would be a lot worse. Any errors still in the report are mine and mine
alone.\footnote{For an interesting take on this last sentence, see \emph{The
  Preface Paradox} \cite{makinson65prefaceparadox,
